                                premises and you are looking to relocate, a well planned exit strategy is likely to save
                                you money and stress. In particular, it is important that you deal correctly with the
                                legalities of terminating your lease and consider at an early stage your potential

                                best to reduce your overall financial exposure.</span></p>
