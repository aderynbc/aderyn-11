                                to the condition of a property during the term of a tenancy, or when the lease ends. We
                                resolve dilapidation disputes on behalf of landlords and tenants by utilising our expert
                                knowledge and years of experience.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We advise both landlords and
                                tenants on prospective liability during the term of a lease, and provide market
                                appropriate and legal tested advice to deal with the same. Similarly we will undertake
                                an assessment at, or near, lease expiry and prepare an appropriate schedule for service
                                on tenants when acting for the landlord. When acting for tenants, we will review any
                                received schedules and formulate an appropriate response to mitigate liability.</span>
